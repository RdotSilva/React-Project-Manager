## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)

## Retrospective

This is my retrospective for this project. I spent approximately 4 hours from start to finish. This includes initial research and design and final implementation. I set a hard stop at 4 hours for this project and the result is what I managed to get finished.

I started by reading all of the provided instruction documents, going over the assets, and looking at the Figma design that was provided. After doing this I was able to create a list of features that I would need to implement. I started to break things down and make notes on how
I would tackle the project.

After initial research and design I created the repo and bootstrapped a project using create-react-app. I decided to mimic the Gitflow workflow for this project and created feature branches for each individual feature I wanted to create. After each feature was built I merged my code into main and started on another feature branch. For my commit style I like to make clear and frequent commits to keep a clean history of my code so I can refer back if needed.

I have broken the code up into screens and components. Screens are the main pages that a user will visit and I render my components inside of the screens. I've added JSDoc comments to document components and added additional inline comments as necessary.

I was not able to complete all of the main features that were requested. However, I feel that I have demonstrated my ability to write clean and re-usable React components as well as an understanding for Front End development. I spent a lot of time with the design and trying to integrate Ant Design. If I had to do it again, I would have started with all of the logic for the main features, and then focused on the design.

In conclusion, this was a really fun and challenging exercise. I enjoyed working through the problem and applying my skills, and I was even able to pick up a few new tools/technologies.

## TODO Features/Bugs

These are features or ideas that can be added or tweaked in the future.

1. Edit Project Feature

2. Fix Delete Project Feature

   - Look into the delete project feature, there is a bug when removing the project from the project list

3. Clean Up Design
   - Clean up the design and make it look more like the mocks that were provided
